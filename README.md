Bachelor Project : StackOverFlow
================================

The project aims is to provide help for online students who follow programming courses. We started from the observation that students often pause or seek back video when they have a difficulty. They do this to play back the content and try to better understand. So we try to provide them with some efficient help when they needs it. The main idea was to display some useful links when we thought they need it. To do this we try to match the current content of the subject with a question on Stackoverflow.
